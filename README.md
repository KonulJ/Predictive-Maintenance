# 🛠️ Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning  
**Powered by the C-MAPSS Dataset**

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be applied to sensor data from jet engines to predict **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** and prevent equipment failure. By leveraging the **C-MAPSS dataset**, the application predicts potential breakdowns before they occur—reducing downtime, optimizing maintenance schedules, and improving operational efficiency.

An **interactive dashboard** built using **Plotly Dash** provides visual insights into sensor behavior and model performance.
